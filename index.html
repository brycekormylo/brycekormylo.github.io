    <p>Privacy Policy for Traces</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which Traces collects, uses, maintains, and discloses information
        collected from users (each, a "User") of the Traces mobile application ("App"). This Privacy Policy applies to
        the App and all products and services offered by Traces.</p>

    <p>1. Personal Identification Information</p>

    <p>We may collect personal identification information from Users in various ways when they use our App. This
        information may include, but is not limited to, the User's name, email address, and any other information
        voluntarily submitted by the User. Users can visit the App anonymously, and we will only collect personal
        identification information from Users if they voluntarily submit such information to us. Users can always refuse
        to supply personal identification information, except that it may prevent them from engaging in certain
        App-related activities.</p>

    <p>2. Non-Personal Identification Information</p>

    <p>We may collect non-personal identification information about Users whenever they interact with our App.
        Non-personal identification information may include the type of device used to access the App, the operating
        system, the browser, and other technical information.</p>

    from Users.</p>

    <p>4. How We Protect Your Information</p>

    <p>We adopt appropriate data collection, storage, and processing practices, as well as security measures, to

        username, password, transaction information, and data stored on our App.</p>

    <p>5. Sharing Your Personal Information</p>

    <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent Users' personal identification information to others. We may share generic
